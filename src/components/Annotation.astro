<Headline>Step 2: Annotate the following tweets</Headline>

<Paragraph>
  We listed a selection of possible ambiguous and polarising tweets below. Your
  task is annotating them along two dimensions: topic and sentiment. We provide
  a detailed description for each topic below. Please read them carefully. For
  the sentiment, your task is to choose between three options: The author's
  opinion is neutral (<span class="text-slate-600 font-bold">Neutral</span>),
  positive (<span class="text-slate-600 font-bold">Positiv</span>) or negative (<span
    class="text-slate-600 font-bold">Negativ</span
  >) towards the chosen topic. You may encounter tweets with two or more
  possible topics. Please select the one most prominent in your opinion. Select
  the label unclassifiable (<span class="text-slate-600 font-bold"
    >Nicht zuordenbar</span
  >) if you find a tweet not assignable to any topic.
