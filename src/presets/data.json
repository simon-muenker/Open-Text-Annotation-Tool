Of course, all your statements are voluntary and remain anonymous. You may find some options not exactly fitting your situation. If that is the case, choose the closest possible value. Note that we simplified the options regarding questions of gender, origin, and religion. That allows for a streamlined evaluation and is not meant to be discriminating.

We provide a detailed description for each topic below. Please read them carefully. For the sentiment, your task is to choose between three options: The author's opinion is neutral (Neutral), positive (Positiv) or negative (Negativ) towards the chosen topic. You may encounter tweets with two or more possible topics. Please select the one most prominent in your opinion. Select the label unclassifiable (Nicht zuordenbar) if you find a tweet not assignable to any topic."

Thus, interested ones can examine their file and inspect the collected data. We ask not to modify the contents as that would complicate evaluation. Finally, upload the received file to the cloud storage provided by the universities of Rhineland-Palatinate. We opt for the two stages approach to ensure data transparency and limit the usage of non-education service providers.",
