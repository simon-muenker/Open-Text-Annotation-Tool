        Our research interest is to analyze the agreement of text classification
        between human annotators and large language models (LLM) questioned
        through prompting. Thus, your task in the survey is annotating Tweets in
        terms of their topic and sentiment. In addition, we encourage you to
        provide us with selected socio-demographic features. We will utilize
        these to analyze if the LLM's response resembles the opinion of specific
        groups.

      <Paragraph>
        Please provide us with your genuine data. If you like not to answer a
        question, leave the field's value with the default None. Of course, all
        your statements are voluntary and remain anonymous. You may find some
        options not exactly fitting your situation. If that is the case, choose
        the closest possible value.

        Note that we simplified the options regarding questions of gender,
        origin, and religion. That allows for a streamlined evaluation and is
        not meant to be discriminating. If you have ethical concerns, <a

      <Headline>Step 2: Annotate the following tweets</Headline>

      <Paragraph>
        We listed a selection of possible ambiguous and polarising tweets below.
        Your task is annotating them along two dimensions: topic and sentiment.
        We provide a detailed description for each topic below. Please read them
        carefully. For the sentiment, your task is to choose between three
        options: The author's opinion is neutral (<span
          class="font-bold text-slate-600">Neutral</span
        >), positive (<span class="font-bold text-slate-600">Positiv</span>) or
        negative (<span class="font-bold text-slate-600">Negativ</span>) towards
        the chosen topic. You may encounter tweets with two or more possible
        topics. Please select the one most prominent in your opinion. Select the
        label unclassifiable (<span class="font-bold text-slate-600"
          >Nicht zuordenbar</span
        >) if you find a tweet not assignable to any topic.

      <Headline>Step 3: Submit the results</Headline>

      <Paragraph>
        After finishing the study, download your data to your local file system.
        We save results as a plain-text JSON file. Thus, interested ones can
        examine their file and inspect the collected data. We ask not to modify
        the contents as that would complicate evaluation.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Finally, upload the received file to the cloud storage provided by the
        universities of Rhineland-Palatinate. We opt for the two stages approach
        to ensure data transparency and limit the usage of non-education service
        providers.
